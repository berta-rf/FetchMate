## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the FetchMate Flask app:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the FetchMate repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:berta-rf/FetchMate.git
cd FetchMate
```
### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional): 
You can create and activate a virtual environment if you want an isolated environment for your project. If you skip this step, the packages will be installed globally.
```bash
cd /path/to/your/FetchMate/src
python3 -m venv venv
```

#### Activate the virtual environment:
On macOS or Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows (Command Prompt):
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On Windows (PowerShell):
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install Dependencies using requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Initialize the Database
Run the Python interpreter and create the necessary database tables:
```bash
python3
```
then
```bash
from app import db
db.create_all()
exit()
```

### 5. Obtain an API Key:
To use the features of this project, you need to obtain an API key from https://api-ninjas.com/api/dogs. Here's how:

- Sign up or log in to https://api-ninjas.com/api/dogs.
- Navigate to the API key generation section in your account dashboard.
- Generate a new API key and copy it.
- Open the config.py file in the src folder of your project. Add the API key you obtained in the previous step:
```python
API_KEY = "your_generated_api_key_here"
```

###  6. Run the App
Run the Flask app using the following command:

```bash
python3 app.py
```
or
```bash
python app.py
```

The app will be served at http://localhost:5001.


## Test
We take testing seriously at FetchMate to ensure the reliability and functionality of our application. We have a comprehensive suite of tests that cover different aspects of the system, including unit tests for core functionality and end-to-end tests to validate the user experience.

### Unit testing
To run unit tests for the utility functions in utils.py, follow these steps:

#### 1. Navigate to the Test Directory: 
Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the project, specifically the src folder where the tests are located.
```bash
cd path/to/src
```

#### 2. Run Unit Tests: 
Execute the following command to run the unit tests for the utility functions.
```bash
python -m unittest testing/test_utils_match_breeds.py
```

### End-to-End testing
We also perform end-to-end tests to validate the behavior of our Flask application in a real-world browser scenario. Here's how to run these tests:

#### 1. Install Playwright: 
In the terminal, run the following command to install Playwright.
```bash
playwright install
```

#### 2. Run End-to-End Tests: 
From the src folder, execute the following command to run the browser tests.
```bash
python -m pytest testing/test_web.py
```

Please note that the Flask app must be running for the end-to-end tests to work as expected.
